    I oppted to cache images in the actual Recipe models themselves. This seemed more effient and witn less code, rather than creating a full fledged cached images manager class to store them in that utilizes old NS object classes, and then having to cast objects back and forth. This also made the codebase more readable.
 
    For completeness and transparency, I've included the CachedImagesManager.swift file in the project navigator for your viewing pleasure :)
